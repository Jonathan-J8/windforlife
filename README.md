## Mission

FieldBox.ai just got selected in the final round for a new business opportunity: refactoring the frontend for the application of WindForLife, a non-profit organization providing real-time wind data around the world.  
Our CEO is ecstatic, as a hobbyist kitesurfer, he actually uses their application everyday and clearly wants us to win the contract. In order to showcase the company’s skills, he kindly asks the engineering team if they could prepare a quick POC so he can demonstrate to WindForLife that FieldBox.ai is the perfect partner for them.  
The demo is just a couple hours away... Never shy for a fun challenge, you quickly volunteer to design and build a first prototype for this interface. “Let’s make the CEO’s dream come true !”, you think to yourself, before frantically starting typing on your keyboard.
